3. Contributing:
----------------
pwd is intended to be an educational project. Therefore, code clarity will always
take precedence over execution speed, binary size, and programming style.

In that vein, instead of contributing to pwd, you should use pwd as inspiration
and implement your own pwd-like utility.

If you really want to contribute to pwd, I am not going to stop you however. After
making sure that your changes conform to the pwd vision (code clarity above all)
submit a pull request via Github.
